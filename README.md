# Battery_logger

A Python program I made really quickly, it logs your battery stats into a csv.
Run Battery_Logger_Runney.py on startup and it will read the specified X seconds
from Time_In_Seconds.txt, and run Battery_Logger.py every X seconds.

You can also run Battery_Grapher.py to graph the log.
